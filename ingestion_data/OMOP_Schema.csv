In OMOP the Vocabulary breaks these two clinical ideas into two codes; one becomes the OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID and the other becomes the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID. It is important when using the Observation table to keep this possibility in mind and to examine the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID field for relevant information.","Note that the value of VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID may be provided through mapping from a source Concept which contains the content of the Observation. In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table in addition to the ‘Maps to’ record contains a second record with the relationship_id set to ‘Maps to value’. For example, ICD10 Z82.4 ‘Family history of ischaemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system’ has a ‘Maps to’ relationship to 4167217 ‘Family history of clinical finding’ as well as a ‘Maps to value’ record to 134057 ‘Disorder of cardiovascular system’.",Integer,No,NO,YES,CONCEPT,concept_id,"[CONCEPT, concept_id]"
